        This is my webpage for <strong>COSC 52</strong>. I built this as part of SA1.
        <p>
            I'm taking this class mainly for these reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing power to build out and share my creative ideas</li>
            <li>Working with a group to develop a cool project that I can share with friends and family.</li>
            <li>Partial satisfaction of my CS major</li>
        </ul>
